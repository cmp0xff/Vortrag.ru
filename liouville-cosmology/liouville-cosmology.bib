  abstract    = {We apply the formalism of quantum cosmology to models containing a phantom field. Three models are discussed explicitly: a toy model, a model with an exponential phantom potential, and a model with phantom field accompanied by a negative cosmological constant. In all these cases we calculate the classical trajectories in configuration space and give solutions to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in quantum cosmology. In the cases of the toy model and the model with exponential potential we are able to solve the Wheeler-DeWitt equation exactly. For comparison, we also give the corresponding solutions for an ordinary scalar field. We discuss in particular the behaviour of wave packets in minisuperspace. For the phantom field these packets disperse in the region that corresponds to the Big Rip singularity. This thus constitutes a genuine quantum region at large scales, described by a regular solution of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. For the ordinary scalar field, the Big-Bang singularity is avoided. Some remarks on the arrow of time in phantom models as well as on the relation of phantom models to loop quantum cosmology are given.},

We address here the issue whether some of these singularities, the big freeze and the big demarrage, can be avoided in quantum cosmology. We use the framework of quantum geometrodynamics. We restrict our attention to a class of models whose matter content can be described by a generalized Chaplygin gas and be represented by a scalar field with an appropriate potential. Employing the DeWitt criterium that the wave function be zero at the classical singularity, we show that a class of solutions to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation fulfilling this condition can be found. These solutions thus avoid the classical singularity. We discuss the reasons for the remaining ambiguity in fixing the solution.},

This expression involves a one-parameter family of conserved current densities J_a^\mu, with a\in(-1,1), that are analogous to the chiral current density for spin half fields. The conservation of J_a^\mu is related to a global gauge symmetry of the Klein-Gordon fields whose gauge group is U(1) for rational a and the multiplicative group of positive real numbers for irrational a. We show that the associated gauge symmetry is responsible for the conservation of the total probability of the localization of the field in space. This provides a simple resolution of the paradoxical situation resulting from the fact that the probability current density for free scalar fields is neither covariant nor conserved. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of our approach for free real scalar fields offering a direct proof of the uniqueness of the relativistically invariant positive-definite inner product on the space of real Klein-Gordon fields. We also explore an extension of our results to scalar fields minimally coupled to an electromagnetic field.},

We determine all the positive-definite inner products on the space H of the solutions of such an equation and establish their physical equivalence. We use a simple realization of the unique Hilbert space structure on H to construct the observables of the theory explicitly. In general, there are infinitely many choices for the Hamiltonian each leading to a different notion of time-evolution in H. Among these is a particular choice that generates t-translations in H and identifies t with time whenever D is t-independent. For a t-dependent D, we show that t-translations never correspond to unitary evolutions in H, and t cannot be identified with time. We apply these ideas to develop a formulation of quantum cosmology based on the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for a Friedman-Robertson-Walker model coupled to a real scalar field. We solve the Hilbert space problem, construct the observables, introduce a new set of the wave functions of the universe, reformulate the quantum theory in terms of the latter, reduce the problem of time to the determination of a Hamiltonian operator acting in L^2(\R)\oplus L^2(\R), show that the factor-ordering problem is irrelevant for the kinematics of the quantum theory, and propose a formulation of the dynamics. Our method allows for a genuine probabilistic interpretation and a unitary Schreodinger time-evolution.},

We review the observational evidence for the current accelerated expansion of the universe and present a number of dark energy models in addition to the conventional cosmological constant, paying particular attention to scalar field models such as quintessence, K-essence, tachyon, phantom and dilatonic models. The importance of cosmological scaling solutions is emphasized when studying the dynamical system of scalar fields including coupled dark energy. We study the evolution of cosmological perturbations allowing us to confront them with the observation of the Cosmic Microwave Background and Large Scale Structure and demonstrate how it is possible in principle to reconstruct the equation of state of dark energy by also using Supernovae Ia observational data. We also discuss in detail the nature of tracking solutions in cosmology, particle physics and braneworld models of dark energy, the nature of possible future singularities, the effect of higher order curvature terms to avoid a Big Rip singularity, and approaches to modifying gravity which leads to a late-time accelerated expansion without recourse to a new form of dark energy.},

In particular, we present the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, Little Rip and Pseudo-Rip universes, the phantom and quintessence cosmologies with Type I, II, III and IV finite-time future singularities and non-singular dark energy universes. In the first part, we explain the $\Lambda$CDM model and well-established observational tests which constrain the current cosmic acceleration. After that, we investigate the dark fluid universe where a fluid has quite general equation of state (EoS) [including inhomogeneous or imperfect EoS]. All the above dark energy cosmologies for different fluids are explicitly realized, and their properties are also explored. It is shown that all the above dark energy universes may mimic the $\Lambda$CDM model currently, consistent with the recent observational data. Furthermore, special attention is paid to the equivalence of different dark energy models. We consider single and multiple scalar field theories, tachyon scalar theory and holographic dark energy as models for current acceleration with the features of quintessence/phantom cosmology, and demonstrate their equivalence to the corresponding fluid descriptions. In the second part, we study another equivalent class of dark energy models which includes $F(R)$ gravity as well as $F(R)$ Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity and the teleparallel $f(T)$ gravity. The cosmology of such models representing the $\Lambda$CDM-like universe or the accelerating expansion with the quintessence/phantom nature is described. Finally, we approach the problem of testing dark energy and alternative gravity models to general relativity by cosmography. We show that degeneration among parameters can be removed by accurate data analysis of large data samples and also present the examples.},

  abstract    = {We review recent developments (up to January 2004) of the Liouville field theory and its matrix model dual. This review consists of three parts. In part I, we review the bosonic Liouville theory. After briefly reviewing the necessary background, we discuss the bulk structure constants (the DOZZ formula) and the boundary states (the FZZT brane and the ZZ brane). Various applications are also presented. In part II, we review the supersymmetric extension of the Liouville theory. We first discuss the bulk structure constants and the branes as in the bosonic Liouville theory, and then we present the matrix dual descriptions with some applications. In part III, the Liouville theory on unoriented surfaces is reviewed. After introducing the crosscap state, we discuss the matrix model dual description and the tadpole cancellation condition. This review also includes some original material such as the derivation of the conjectured dual action for the N = 2 Liouville theory from other known dualities and the comparison of the Liouville crosscap state with the c = 0 unoriented matrix model. This is based on my master's thesis submitted to Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, University of Tokyo on January 2004.},

The effort to explain this current state has focused attention on cosmological models in which the dominant component of the cosmic energy density has negative pressure, with an equation of state $w \ge -1$. Remarking that most observations are consistent with models right up to the $w=-1$ or cosmological constant ($\Lambda$) limit, it is natural to ask what lies on the other side, at $w<-1$. In this regard, we construct a toy model of a ``phantom'' energy component which possesses an equation of state $w<-1$. Such a component is found to be compatible with most classical tests of cosmology based on current data, including the recent type 1a SNe data as well as the cosmic microwave background anisotropy and mass power spectrum. If the future observations continue to allow $w<-1$, then barring unanticipated systematic effects, the dominant component of the cosmic energy density may be stranger than anything expected.},

  abstract    = {We offer a new proposal for cosmic singularity resolution based upon a quantum cosmology with a unitary bounce. This proposal is illustrated via a novel quantization of a mini-superspace model in which there can be superpositions of the cosmological constant. This possibility leads to a finite, bouncing unitary cosmology. Whereas the usual Wheeler--DeWitt cosmology generically displays pathological behaviour in terms of non-finite expectation values and non-unitary dynamics, the finiteness and unitarity of our model are formally guaranteed. For classically singular models with a massless scalar field and cosmological constant, we show that well-behaved quantum observables can be constructed and generic solutions to the universal Schrodinger equation are singularity-free. Key features of the solutions of our model include a cosmic bounce due to quantum gravitational effects, a well-defined FLRW limit far from the bounce, and a super-inflationary epoch in the intermediate region. Furthermore, our model displays novel features including: i) superpositions of values of the cosmological constant; ii) a non-zero scattering length around the big bounce; and iii) bound 'Efimov universe' states for negative cosmological constant. The last feature provides a new platform for quantum simulation of the early universe. A companion paper provides detailed interpretation and analysis of particular cosmological solutions.},

The time variable is recovered, in this context, by using the Schutz's formalism for a radiative fluid. Two cases are considered: a phantom scalar field and an ordinary scalar field. For the first case, it is shown that the evolution is unitary provided a convenient factor ordering and inner product measure are chosen; the same happens for the ordinary scalar field, except for some special cases for which the Hamiltonian is not self-adjoint but admits a self-adjoint extension. In all cases, even for those cases not exhibiting unitary evolution, the formal computation of the expectation value of the scale factor indicates a non-singular bounce. The importance of the unitary evolution in quantum cosmology is briefly discussed.},

A direct canonical quantization of a perturbed inflationary universe model is implemented, which leads to a Wheeler-DeWitt equation. For this equation, a semiclassical approximation is applied in order to obtain a Schroedinger equation with quantum-gravitational correction terms, from which we calculate the corrections to the power spectra. We go beyond the de Sitter case discussed earlier and analyze our model in the first slow-roll approximation, considering terms linear in the slow-roll parameters. We find that the dominant correction term from the de Sitter case, which leads to an enhancement of power on the largest scales, gets modified by terms proportional to the slow-roll parameters. A correction to the tensor-to-scalar ratio is also found at second order in the slow-roll parameters. Making use of the available experimental data, the magnitude of these quantum-gravitational corrections is estimated. Finally, the effects for the temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background are qualitatively obtained.},

On including such effects it is seen that the unitarity violating effects previously found disappear. A quantum loop space formulation (based on a hybrid quantisation, polymer for gravitation and canonical for matter) also refers to the BO method. It does not involve the classical limit for gravitation and has a highly peaked initial scalar field state. We point out that it does not resemble in any way to our traditional BO approach. Instead it does resemble an alternative, canonically quantised, non BO approach which we have also previously discussed.},
